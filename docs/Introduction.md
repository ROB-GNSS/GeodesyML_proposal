GeodesyML, an XML implementation of the eGeodesy model (developed by the Permanent Committee on Geodesy (PCG) of the Australian and New Zealand Intergovernmental Committee on Surveying and Mapping, with the support of the International GNSS Service (IGS) (see [http://www.geodesyml.org](http://www.geodesyml.org)), is a Geography Markup Language (GML) application schema for transfer of geodetic information. It is aligned with international standards such as ISO19115-1:2014 and the GML developed  within  the  OGC. 

The proposal for an extension of GeodesyML specified in this document concerns the exchange of GNSS station information and is based on the specifications of version 0.5 (available at [https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/GeodesyML](https://github.com/GeoscienceAustralia/GeodesyML)) and contains additional classes and properties from other vocabularies (domain specific vocabulary) when necessary. It stems for the need to take into account GNSS data users requests when querying and/or downloading station information (e.g., information on the precise coordinates of the GNSS station) as well as FAIR data principles (e.g., attach data license, include file provenance information, etc.)

All proposed changes/extensions to GeodesyML are optional and therefore guarantee full backwards compatibility.
